# gravity-simulator
Simulate several gravitational bodies in 3D space, tracing their paths as they go.

This started as a port of my [Processing app](https://github.com/HarrySadleir/gravitySimulator) of the same name, with the aim of learning web technologies, and eventually experimenting with local hosting.
